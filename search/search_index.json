Finding Purah Dive through the skies towards the large tower in the distance, but be cautious not to get too distracted as it's recommended to progress the story with important tools. Keep an eye out for fallen debris and rocks from the Sky Islands above that now litter the landscape. These spots often contain materials that can only be found in the sky. The first landmark you'll encounter is the Ranch Ruins, featuring a track, a ruined tower, and debris. Here, you can find a Korok hiding under a rock in the tower and a chest holding 20 rupees under an awning along the track. Watch out for Bokoblins in the area, as they may carry useful ingredients or elemental fruit that they can throw at you. Proceed beyond the ruins to find the Ranch Ruins Cave, where you'll encounter a new enemy type called Horriblin. Defeat them by shooting them with an arrow to stun them and rush in for the final blow. Before taking the main path up, explore a tiny alcove on the left to find a trove of Brightcap, Brightbloom Seed, a Traveler's Bow, and arrows. Continue along the main path to reach the Horriblin's lair and loot a chest. Look to the right of the cave exit to find another enemy, a Bubbulfrog, that you can defeat for its drop. On the other side of the cave, you'll find the Mabe Village Ruins, where you can scavenge rusty weapons and stock up on arrows by using Ultrahand to lift and drop crates. Spot the group of Bokoblins being led by a Boss Bokoblin in the distance, but consider waiting until you have better weapons and gear. Look for a well on the far side of the broken village, which contains Glowing Cave Fish, Sticky Lizards, Brightcaps, and ore veins hidden within rubble. Break the rubble with makeshift hammer weapons. When you're ready to proceed, head across the field, avoiding the Bokoblin column, and reach the new settlement in front of Hyrule Castle Town, known as the Sacred Ground Ruins. Interact with the people and talk to Purah, the Sheikah Tribe's foremost researcher of ancient tech, who will give you urgent tasks to complete.

This unique ability allows you to meld objects with your weapons, creating formidable fused creations that enhance attack power, durability, and can even modify weapon properties.

It can be found on the ground, south of Lookout Landing. This shrine presents a series of puzzles that involve manipulating different shapes and blocks to progress. Puzzle Solutions Upon entering the shrine, you'll find a room to the left with a long piece of stone in an X shape on its side and a hole in the wall with a similar shape. To proceed, equip the Ultrahand by pressing and holding the L button. Tap the L button to highlight the X block, then lift it into the air. Run around the room while holding the block and push it through the X-shaped hole. You can rotate the block in mid-air by pressing the R button and using the D-pad. Pick up the X block again in the next room and use the R button to rotate it so that the X is towards Link. This creates a bridge that you can cross. Note the green shadow cast by the X block to align it with the bridge. Use the ladder to exit the chasm. In the next area, turn right and you'll find two cubes fused into a new shape. Pick up the double cube block and bring it to the gap. Hold the R button and rotate the blocks until they can fit through the hole. Experimentation may be needed, but they can fit in the configuration shown. Before proceeding to the final room, observe the wall between the rooms with the double cube holes. You'll notice platforms and a chest above them. Turn the double cube on its side and place one cube in the divot beneath the platforms. This allows you to climb the blocks and reach the platforms with a treasure chest containing a \"Hasty Elixir.\" Across the room, there is another wall with a hole. Use the R button rotation again to spin the block to fit through the hole as shown in the picture. Drop the block next to the platforms leading to the glowing shrine exit. Nestle one block behind the platform in the gap. You can either drop the double cube on its side and jump up it, then jump the gap, or select Ascend with the R button to travel up through the block vertically.

To proceed, equip the Ultrahand by pressing and holding the L button. Tap the L button to highlight the X block, then lift it into the air. Run around the room while holding the block and push it through the X-shaped hole. You can rotate the block in mid-air by pressing the R button and using the D-pad. Pick up the X block again in the next room and use the R button to rotate it so that the X is towards Link. This creates a bridge that you can cross. Note the green shadow cast by the X block to align it with the bridge. Use the ladder to exit the chasm. In the next area, turn right and you'll find two cubes fused into a new shape. Pick up the double cube block and bring it to the gap. Hold the R button and rotate the blocks until they can fit through the hole. Experimentation may be needed, but they can fit in the configuration shown. Before proceeding to the final room, observe the wall between the rooms with the double cube holes. You'll notice platforms and a chest above them. Turn the double cube on its side and place one cube in the divot beneath the platforms. This allows you to climb the blocks and reach the platforms with a treasure chest containing a \"Hasty Elixir.\" Across the room, there is another wall with a hole. Use the R button rotation again to spin the block to fit through the hole as shown in the picture. Drop the block next to the platforms leading to the glowing shrine exit. Nestle one block behind the platform in the gap. You can either drop the double cube on its side and jump up it, then jump the gap, or select Ascend with the R button to travel up through the block vertically. From there, leap to the platform and exit the shrine.","title":"Puzzle Solutions"},{"location":"shrines/Jiosin/#treasure-chests","text":"Hasty Elixir: Found on the platforms above the double cube puzzle area.
