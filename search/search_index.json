Finding Purah Dive through the skies towards the large tower in the distance, but be cautious not to get too distracted as it's recommended to progress the story with important tools. Keep an eye out for fallen debris and rocks from the Sky Islands above that now litter the landscape. These spots often contain materials that can only be found in the sky. The first landmark you'll encounter is the Ranch Ruins, featuring a track, a ruined tower, and debris. Here, you can find a Korok hiding under a rock in the tower and a chest holding 20 rupees under an awning along the track. Watch out for Bokoblins in the area, as they may carry useful ingredients or elemental fruit that they can throw at you. Proceed beyond the ruins to find the Ranch Ruins Cave, where you'll encounter a new enemy type called Horriblin. Defeat them by shooting them with an arrow to stun them and rush in for the final blow. Before taking the main path up, explore a tiny alcove on the left to find a trove of Brightcap, Brightbloom Seed, a Traveler's Bow, and arrows. Continue along the main path to reach the Horriblin's lair and loot a chest. Look to the right of the cave exit to find another enemy, a Bubbulfrog, that you can defeat for its drop. On the other side of the cave, you'll find the Mabe Village Ruins, where you can scavenge rusty weapons and stock up on arrows by using Ultrahand to lift and drop crates. Spot the group of Bokoblins being led by a Boss Bokoblin in the distance, but consider waiting until you have better weapons and gear. Look for a well on the far side of the broken village, which contains Glowing Cave Fish, Sticky Lizards, Brightcaps, and ore veins hidden within rubble. Break the rubble with makeshift hammer weapons. When you're ready to proceed, head across the field, avoiding the Bokoblin column, and reach the new settlement in front of Hyrule Castle Town, known as the Sacred Ground Ruins. Interact with the people and talk to Purah, the Sheikah Tribe's foremost researcher of ancient tech, who will give you urgent tasks to complete.

Align the shape in such a way that it creates connecting pathways between the sky islands. This will enable you to walk across the paths and reach the sky crystal. Once you have successfully obtained the sky crystal, carry it back to the shrine's location. As you bring the sky crystal to its rightful place, Jinodok Shrine will appear before you.","title":"Location and Introduction"},{"location":"shrines/Jinodok/#puzzle-solutions","text":"Reaching the shrine is the puzzle itself.

It can be found on the ground, south of Lookout Landing. This shrine presents a series of puzzles that involve manipulating different shapes and blocks to progress. Puzzle Solutions Upon entering the shrine, you'll find a room to the left with a long piece of stone in an X shape on its side and a hole in the wall with a similar shape. To proceed, equip the Ultrahand by pressing and holding the L button. Tap the L button to highlight the X block, then lift it into the air. Run around the room while holding the block and push it through the X-shaped hole. You can rotate the block in mid-air by pressing the R button and using the D-pad. Pick up the X block again in the next room and use the R button to rotate it so that the X is towards Link. This creates a bridge that you can cross. Note the green shadow cast by the X block to align it with the bridge. Use the ladder to exit the chasm. In the next area, turn right and you'll find two cubes fused into a new shape. Pick up the double cube block and bring it to the gap. Hold the R button and rotate the blocks until they can fit through the hole. Experimentation may be needed, but they can fit in the configuration shown. Before proceeding to the final room, observe the wall between the rooms with the double cube holes. You'll notice platforms and a chest above them. Turn the double cube on its side and place one cube in the divot beneath the platforms. This allows you to climb the blocks and reach the platforms with a treasure chest containing a \"Hasty Elixir.\" Across the room, there is another wall with a hole. Use the R button rotation again to spin the block to fit through the hole as shown in the picture. Drop the block next to the platforms leading to the glowing shrine exit. Nestle one block behind the platform in the gap. You can either drop the double cube on its side and jump up it, then jump the gap, or select Ascend with the R button to travel up through the block vertically. From there, leap to the platform and exit the shrine. Treasure Chests Hasty Elixir: Found on the platforms above the double cube puzzle area.

The shrine is located in a cave system under the hill and offers various challenges for the players. This guide will provide you with the path to the shrine and details about the challenges you'll face. Puzzle Solutions There are two ways to reach the shrine. The easier path is located southeast of Crenel Peak, where you'll find a glowing cave fish. Defeat the Blue Horriblin and destroy the rock wall on the right to access a shorter path to the shrine. Alternatively, you can take the Crenel Peak Cave west entrance, which is located off the road. Defeat the enemies inside the cave and proceed further. In the cave, you'll come across rock walls that need to be destroyed. Use bombs or a Rusty Claymore fused with rocks to break through the walls. As you progress, you'll encounter Blue Horriblin and tight quarters. Defeat the enemies and continue exploring the cave. There are two paths that diverge after destroying the fourth set of walls. The path on the right is optional and requires two bombs to proceed. If you choose this path, defeat the Bubbulfrog for a special reward. Otherwise, proceed on the left path. The leftmost path contains sticky lizards, a Giant Brightbloom Seed, Luminous Stone, Brightcap mushrooms, and finally, the Jojon Shrine. Enter the shrine, where you'll face the Proving Grounds: Rotation challenge. In the shrine, collect the available weapons, including a wooden stick, thick stick, and an old wooden shield. Cross the turning gears and defeat the Zonai Soldier Construct. Proceed to the next gear and eliminate another Construct. Use Ultrahand to remove the flame emitter tower. Further ahead, you'll find explosive barrels, Rusty Halberds, a Construct Bow, arrows, Rusty Broadsword, and Bomb Flowers. Use the Zonai Spring to reach the second floor. On the second floor, defeat the soldier armed with fire arrows. Grab the arrows and bow and face the final Construct. Shoot an arrow at its eye to stun it, then continue the fight.

You can find the entrance to the shrine on the south wall of the canyon cliffs. Upon entering Kopeki Drifts Cave you will encounter a large cold pool of water that inflicts damage upon contact. Your objective is to create an ice bridge across the pool to reach the Nouda Shrine on the far beach. To construct the bridge, you'll need bridge parts. Explore the right side of the cave and look for a tunnel leading to a chamber with a Like-Like creature. This creature continually regurgitates ice blocks that you can utilize to build the bridge. Carefully move the ice blocks to the main chamber, avoiding the Like-Like, and assemble the bridge. You can choose to create an elaborate bridge around the stalactites or take a straight line approach by getting as close as possible to the far shore and then jumping into the water for the final stretch. Puzzle Solutions To successfully navigate and overcome the challenges in Nouda Shrine, follow these steps: Upon entering the main room of Nouda Shrine, grab the bow, sticks, and arrows provided to you. Eliminate the Construct archer to the right by aiming for a clean headshot. Make your way to the platform where the archer was positioned. Be cautious of the second archer equipped with electric arrows beneath the tower. Locate the Fire Fruit on the platform and attach it to an arrow. Shoot the Fire Fruit-laden arrow towards the electric archer, ensuring that you get its attention first. This will cause the archer to drop Shock Fruits with an electric effect. Utilize the Shock Fruits to your advantage, as they will cause the leaves on the ground to flare up and eliminate the electric archer. Engage with the remaining enemies below, utilizing any weapons and items they drop.

Look up to find a Bubbulfrog hiding in the stalactites, which you can shoot down with an arrow. Proceed into the cave and defeat the Like Like blocking the path to reach the entrance of the shrine. Puzzle Solutions Upon entering Tadarok Shrine, you will encounter a pool of water with two electrical devices that pump electricity into it, making it dangerous to cross. Use the Ultrahand from your inventory to lift the spheres out of the pool and place them on the far surface, ensuring the water becomes safe to cross. Before crossing the water, take the stone cube from the entrance room with you. In the next chamber to your left, you will find a treasure chest. Protect the ice cube from the flames by placing the stone cube in front of them. Ensure the ice cube remains full-sized, replacing it if it shrinks. Use the Ultrahand to move the ice cube to the treasure chest and climb on it to claim your reward. Next, you will come across another electrified pool of water and a lava pool. Remove the sphere from the electrified pool to make it safe, and also take the second stone cube from this pool. Use the Ultrahand to move both stone cubes, one from the pool and one from the entrance room, into the lava pool, creating a path across. In this area, you can save the wooden crate from burning by immediately dousing it in the nearby pool. Move this cube across the lava and into the central room. To reach the high ledge with the exit, you will need to solve a challenging puzzle. Attach the two stone cubes vertically using the Ultrahand. Then, attach the wooden cube to the top of the stack, positioning it halfway up and over the side to create a step. Lift the bottom of the stack with the Ultrahand onto the platform with the fire, taking care not to expose the wood. The two stone cubes will remain safe. Use the stone cubes to block the flames, and the wooden cube will provide enough height to reach the platform above, positioned about halfway down. To pass through the stone cubes, place the ice cube underneath them and activate Ascend to go through the two stone cubes, emerge on top, and then hop onto the wooden cube to exit the shrine.

Puzzle Solutions Upon entering the shrine, you'll find yourself in a large room with two sides. The main puzzle that needs to be solved is straight ahead, which involves getting a constantly falling ball into its port on the lower right. On the left side of the room, you'll find auxiliary tools and the shrine's treasure chest. Start by heading towards the left side to collect the treasure chest. To reach it, use the stakes provided in the opening platform. These stakes can be used to stick structures into various surfaces. Grab the longer metal platform using Ultrahand and look towards the moving pillar. Wait until the pillar moves all the way down and stops. Attach the metal platform to the beam sticking out of the pillar, then hop on it. Cross to the left structure using the air current and glide over to the treasure chest. Inside, you'll find x5 Arrows. Return to the main puzzle structure and glide up to the high white metal platform in front of it. The first step is to gain control of the falling ball. Use one of the stakes from the wall as a stopper by placing it in front of the spot where the ball falls from its initial slide. Next, ensure that the ball is directed towards the port. Place another stake from the wall under the moving white seesaw platform when the left side is in the air and the right side is down. This will guide the ball towards the port, but don't drop it yet. Utilize the remaining stake to act as a stopper for the ball when it drops. Position it slightly below the right side of the white seesaw. This will help push the ball onto the metal track near the spinning wheel. Release the ball and let it fall onto the metal tracks. Adjust as needed to ensure it stops on the tracks before reaching the wheel. To automate the process, move the stake that was blocking the ball just to the left of it, allowing it to slowly release whenever it's ready to drop again. Once the ball is on the metal track, take the nearest spike and place it halfway on the grey part of the spinning wheel. This will gently push the ball towards its port.
