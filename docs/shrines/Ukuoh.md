## Puzzle Steps 

1. Use Ultrahand to grab a nearby plank and cross the small gap in front of you.
2. Proceed to the next platform and use Ultrahand to fuse two planks together to create a longer bridge. Cross the second, larger gap.
3. In the back right corner, on top of a pedestal, there is a chest. Grab the bridge you just crossed, rotate it at a 45ยบ angle, and create a ramp to reach the chest. Inside the chest is an Amber.
4. In the next section, fuse a hook to a wooden plank using Ultrahand.
5. Attach the hook and plank to a zip wire, then jump on the wooden plank and ride it across the chasm.
6. Interact with the green sigil on the far side to complete the Ukouh Shrine and the "Ability to Create" trial. You'll earn one Light of Blessing.
