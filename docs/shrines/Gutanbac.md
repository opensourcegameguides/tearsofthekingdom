# Gutanbac Shrine

## Location and Introduction
Gutanbac Shrine, also known as the "Shrine in the Snow" or the "third Shrine," is a shrine located in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. It is situated on the snowy edge of the Great Sky Island and requires warming food to reach it. The shrine can be reached either by starting from the Temple of Time or from the lakeside shrine.

## Puzzle Solutions
To reach Gutanbac Shrine from the Temple of Time, you need to enter the cold temperature region by going through the ruins east of the Temple. Use a Cooking Pot to cook peppers found in front of the slopes to create food that provides cold resistance. Head up the slope into the snow, veer right to reach an icy river, and use the Zonai Devices to cross the river. Follow the river to the left and climb up to reach the shrine.

To reach Gutanbac Shrine from the lakeside shrine, head back down the hill and look for a ditch full of rubble. Use the Fuse ability to break the rocks apart and reveal a low path under the falls. Cross to the other side of the lake and continue down the path to the right. Defeat Constructs and Soldier Constructs along the way and be cautious of their fused weapons. Eventually, you'll reach the shrine.
