# Taunhiy Shrine

## Location and Introduction

Taunhiy Shrine, also known as Combat Training: Archery, is a shrine located in the Central Hyrule Sky. To find Taunhiy Shrine, you need to travel to a Sky Island in Central Hyrule Sky. From Lindor's Brow Skyview Tower, launch into the air and activate your paraglider. Look for a green hand field and activate it to initiate a falling rings puzzle. Leap off the edge of the island and guide Link through all the rings. If you miss a ring, land in the water or on the island with the water, and speak to the Zonai construct who will warp you back to the top for another attempt. Upon successfully completing the rings, the shrine will appear on the sky island near the construct.
