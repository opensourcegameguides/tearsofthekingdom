## Puzzle Solutions

The main challenge in Usazum Shrine is defeating the Hinox. To reach the crystal, you need to enter a dark hole at the base of Satori Mountain, which leads to a cave. Inside the cave, you will see the crystal's ray bobbing around. However, the crystal is located around the neck of the Hinox.

Before facing the Hinox, it is recommended to have arrows. Defeat the Hinox and take the crystal. Before leaving the cave, check the northernmost corner where you can climb up and find a hidden alcove containing a treasure.

Once you have the crystal, return to the shrine spot and place it there to gain access to the shrine. Inside, you will receive Rauru's Blessing. Simply walk forward, collect the treasure (Strong Zonaite Spear), and exit the shrine with a new Light of Blessing.
