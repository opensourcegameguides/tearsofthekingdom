# Jojon Shrine

## Location and Introduction

Jojon Shrine, also known as "Proving Grounds: Rotation," is one of the Central Hyrule shrines in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The shrine is located in a cave system under the hill and offers various challenges for the players. This guide will provide you with the path to the shrine and details about the challenges you'll face.

## Puzzle Solutions

1. There are two ways to reach the shrine. The easier path is located southeast of Crenel Peak, where you'll find a glowing cave fish. Defeat the Blue Horriblin and destroy the rock wall on the right to access a shorter path to the shrine. Alternatively, you can take the Crenel Peak Cave west entrance, which is located off the road. Defeat the enemies inside the cave and proceed further.

2. In the cave, you'll come across rock walls that need to be destroyed. Use bombs or a Rusty Claymore fused with rocks to break through the walls. As you progress, you'll encounter Blue Horriblin and tight quarters. Defeat the enemies and continue exploring the cave.

3. There are two paths that diverge after destroying the fourth set of walls. The path on the right is optional and requires two bombs to proceed. If you choose this path, defeat the Bubbulfrog for a special reward. Otherwise, proceed on the left path.

4. The leftmost path contains sticky lizards, a Giant Brightbloom Seed, Luminous Stone, Brightcap mushrooms, and finally, the Jojon Shrine. Enter the shrine, where you'll face the Proving Grounds: Rotation challenge.

5. In the shrine, collect the available weapons, including a wooden stick, thick stick, and an old wooden shield. Cross the turning gears and defeat the Zonai Soldier Construct. Proceed to the next gear and eliminate another Construct. Use Ultrahand to remove the flame emitter tower.

6. Further ahead, you'll find explosive barrels, Rusty Halberds, a Construct Bow, arrows, Rusty Broadsword, and Bomb Flowers. Use the Zonai Spring to reach the second floor.

7. On the second floor, defeat the soldier armed with fire arrows. Grab the arrows and bow and face the final Construct. Shoot an arrow at its eye to stun it, then continue the fight. Be cautious of its aggressive attacks and use heavier weapons to knock it to a lower floor if needed. Once defeated, your items will be returned, and the exit door will open.
