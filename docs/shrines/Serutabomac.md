# Serutabomac Shrine

## Location and Introduction

Serutabomac Shrine, also known as "The Way Up," is a shrine located on the northeast side of the Hyrule Castle island in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. To reach this shrine, you can use the paraglider to glide over from a high point above the castle or by completing the challenge in Rito Village to make gliding easier. Once you're outside the castle, climb to gain some height and glide over to the northeastern part of the island. The shrine can be found on the B1 level of the dungeon.
